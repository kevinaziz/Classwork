The elephant uses several cylinders which I made using a GL_TRIANGLE_FAN
The elephant's is a cone using GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP
The bird uses Vertex and (random) color arrays for the wings
I made my sphere, cylinder, cone, bird and elephant functions parameterized (I was going to make every click produce a little elephant but I didn't have time)
